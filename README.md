# Mean-Variance (Markovitz) Portfolio Optimization

**Task**:
 - Given a fixed capital, perform mean-variance (Markovitz) portfolio optimization and plot the efficient frontier based on historical stock data

**Tools**:
 - Yahoo Finance API
 - Python Scipy.Optimization library
 - Python Pandas library
 
**Description**:
 - The program calculates historical returns, a covariance matrix, individual stock weigthings that maximize the portfolio Sharpe ratio and the efficient frontier, using Mean-Variance (Markovitz) Portfolio Optimization.

**Assumptions**:
 - The stock returns distribution can be fully described by its first (mean) and second moment (standard deviation). In other words the returns distribution is purely normal.
